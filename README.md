# onRoad 
This repo is created to make changes to the #onRoad project of #NJACK2019
The changes made by me are
1)Updated Cancel Rides option in the menu list.
2)Corrected the spelling of "Profile" option which was initally "Prolile".
3)Created activity_cancel_rides.xml and cancelRides.java.
4)Changes the font colour of the text"Search where uou'd want to go" to blue colour as it was not properly visible initially.

Future Scope
1)Update activity_cancel_rides.xml
and cancelRides.java.
2)Connect the above two files with database so that the booked rides can be viewed in the intent when the option Cancel Rides is clicked.
